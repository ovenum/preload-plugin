# Swup Preload Plugin

A [swup](https://swup.js.org) plugin for preloading pages and faster navigation.

- Links with a `data-swup-preload` attribute will be preloaded automatically
- Hovering a link on pointer devices will preload that link's URL, speeding up load time by a few 100ms. To save server resources, the number of simultaneous preload requests is limited to 5 by default.
- Touch devices will instead preload links at the start of touch events, giving a ~80ms speed-up

## Installation

Install the plugin from npm and import it into your bundle.

```bash
npm install @swup/preload-plugin
```

```js
import SwupPreloadPlugin from '@swup/preload-plugin';
```

Or include the minified production file from a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@swup/preload-plugin@3"></script>
```

## Usage

To run this plugin, include an instance in the swup options.

```javascript
const swup = new Swup({
  plugins: [new SwupPreloadPlugin()]
});
```

## Preloading

Hovering a link will automatically preload it.

```html
<a href="/about">About</a> <!-- will preload when hovering -->
```

To preload specific links, mark them with the `data-swup-preload` attribute.

```html
<a href="/about" data-swup-preload>About</a>
```

To preload all links in a container, mark the container with `data-swup-preload-all`.

```html
<nav data-swup-preload-all>
  <a href="/about">About</a>
  <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
</nav>
```

## Options

### throttle

Type: `Number`, Default: `5`

The *concurrency limit* for simultaneous requests when hovering links on pointer devices.

### preloadInitialPage

Type: `Boolean`, Default: `True`

The reasoning behind preloading the initial page is to allow instant back-button navigation after you've navigated away from it.
In some instances this can cause issues, so you can disable it by setting this option to `false`.

## Methods on the swup instance

The plugin adds two methods for preloading pages to the swup instance.

### preload

Preload a URL or array of URLs. Returns a Promise that resolves when all requested pages have been preloaded.

```js
await swup.preload('/path/to/page');
await swup.preload([
  '/some/page',
  '/other/page'
]);
```

### preloadLinks

Scan the DOM for links with the attribute `[data-swup-preload]` and call `preload` for each URL:

```js
swup.preloadLinks();
```

## Hooks

The plugin creates two new hooks.

> **Note** The visit object might be `undefined` or already settled for these hooks

### page:preload

Fires when a page was preloaded.

```js
swup.hooks.on('page:preload', (_visit, { page }) => console.log('preloaded:', page));
```

### link:hover

Fires every time a link is hovered.

```js
swup.hooks.on('link:hover', (_visit, { el }) => console.log('link hovered:', el));
```
